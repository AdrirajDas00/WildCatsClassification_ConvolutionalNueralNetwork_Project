# WildCatsClassification_ConvolutionalNueralNetwork_Project

This project aims to:

1) Create a CNN model that can accurately classify 4 classes of wild cats (Lions, Tigers, Cheetahs and Leopards).
2) Preprocess images with ImageDataGenerator.
3) Employ Early Stopping and Reduction Learning Rate to our CNN model.
4) Employ Exponential Decay.
5) Compare predictive power among different Transfer Learning Models.
6) Analyse accuracy using Confusion Matrix.
7) Visualize results.
